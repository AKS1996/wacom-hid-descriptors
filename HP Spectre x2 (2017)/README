Manufacturer: HP
Model Name: HP Spectre x2 (2017)
Model Number: 

Notes:
Pictures of this device show a pen that looks very similar to a Wacom
AES-type pen, but the Linux kernel does not currently seem to detect
any kind of Wacom hardware...

The output of journalctl and some searching indicates that this device
likely has an Intel Precise Touch controller which seems to be in charge
of the pen and touch.
