# wacom-hid-descriptors

This is a repository of system and sensor data gathered from numerous
tablet PCs. It is used by the linuxwacom driver developers to ensure
continued device compatibility and as a ready source of basic information
when support requests are received.

## Contributing

We rely on the contributions of a wide cross-section of tablet PC users
to keep this repository up-to-date as manufacturers release new models.
If we don't have information for your specific model of tablet PC, we
would welcome its addition. All you need to do is the following:

 1. Run the [`sysinfo.sh` script](scripts/sysinfo.sh) contained in the
    "scripts" directory.

 2. [File an issue](https://github.com/linuxwacom/wacom-hid-descriptors/issues)
    and attach the tarball generated by the script.
